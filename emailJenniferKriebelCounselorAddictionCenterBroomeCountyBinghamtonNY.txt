Rakesh Kukatla - Available for a Second opinion and/or Care manager
and a Case manager


Hi Jennifer,


Thanks for giving me the letter, signed and dated September, 6 2023.
Just, wanted to follow up on my communication with you, at the time of your
deliverance of the letter to me in ACBC office's, of a need
for a second opinion and/or Care manager and Case manager.


I have a preference for Resident Counselor's and Manager's (aka fresh
graduates who
are in residence training). I also have a gender preference -
female (who have identified in the past, continue to identify in the
present and have reasonable - more likely than not - confidence on
their identity in the future). Please, feel free to share their
profiles and email addresses with me and/or have them communicate with
me directly.


It would be wonderful, to be able to perform conflict of interest and
compatibility check's. Again, it would be great if I can pick up a
copy of the intake (paper's).


I look forward to hearing from you at your convenience.


Thank you,
Rakesh.
